# Title as Question
Digital Surveillance is a step to Mass Surveillance?

# Introduction
Digital Surveillance Systems are must have things in your working areas. Everywhere you see around the world you're covered with them. But have you ever thought only security cameras and motion detection sensors are not the most important part of digital surveillance? Because in the era of internet everything is online and you're pretty sure that nobody is using this information. are you sure that what ever you surf of the internet is not being used by others? I think you already know that, what exactly is making these Big Tech Giants the Emperor of digital era. The DATA linked to you or The Personalized Information about you is making them The Big Tech. And, Thats not the Digital Surveillance, That is **The Mass Surveillance**. This terms isn't new but it's mainly got attention in 2012 when Edwed Snowdon leaked mass surveillance was being done by US government without concern to people. And, You know what, it's not an easy task to stop this non-sense. And, the reason is.. it's hard. We software enginners have opend many complex and sopecificated ways to keep eyes on people. Software and Survellance device that IT forks are creating are being misused by goverments and tech compinies. Now, It time to stop it or limit it but how? because **It's Not Easy**.

# Issues
## 1. Not In Control
The Major offensive Digital Surveillance is being done by mainly two parties first is big tech compinies and second one is goverment. And, you can't have control any of them becuase at the first place you was the person who agrred to data collection. Afterthat, these two main parties starts creating prosonlized profile about you as induvidual.

## 2. A Secrutive Step Toward Mass Surveillance
Just think what if goverment enforce Surveillance on entire contury. Starts collecting data about the individual without thier consern, that's what you would call **Mass Surveillance**. Now, This data can show personal aspects of peopleâ€™s lives. So, The incereasing goverment spying on cizitens is a major setback for a indevidual freedom and privacy in the morden word. We also have seen cases in past like cambreadge analitica.

## 3. Old School Surveillance System
This time not the bad part. Sometimes it is important to setup surveillance system like motion detection, camaera etc. So, first of all its expensive. Expenes of Installing and maintaining Surveillance System can be very high and a headache. These day we just don't capture the things we also do need to store them. Which required knowledge of Automation, cloud storage, and better encryption. And, you may ask why? First, it's not only your home's Surveillance System. Secondly, People are not that fool that they would let you store them insecurely.

# Conclusion
We know things are happening and now we can't stop them in very soon. But we're the reason on the first place who given this advantege to them for free services.
Their is nothing free in morden world and never was. People only think about camears when we say Digital Surveillance but that not true. Even very knowledgable like you manytimes don't know that the era of Digital Surveillance of camrea is long gone. US Started this way back in 2001. And, People still thinks privacy is not important. Still says I have nothing to hide. But everyone know their are many thing in their life that can ruin your entire carrer. Sounds joking ha? Then I wise somehow you could have asked to your Alexa or Google Assistent or your mobile phone, what they actully do behind you without your permission (Check out any of these products privacy policies and terms & conditions). So, what my team thinks is ***It's Hard.*** People required a lot of knowledge to opt-opt of this system. Or, we can hope for best as Edward Snowden said [The Age of Mass Surveillance Will Not Last Forever](https://www.wired.com/story/the-age-of-mass-surveillance-will-not-last-forever/).
